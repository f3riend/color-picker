# color-picker

**Reason for improvement:**
I was obsessed with modern interfaces in web development for a while before, so I was keeping a collection of my favorite colors, but it took me a while to find the colors one by one, so I developed this plugin, normally I could write this with a few lines of code, but I created an interface for ease of coding, you can download and use it as you wish.
